To ensure that the code works in isolation \\n3. To ignore changes in code and requirements \\n4. To break other people's code \\n\\nexplanation: The correct answer is labeled with 2. To ensure that the code works in isolation because unit tests are written for small units or parts of the code to make sure they operate as intended. \\n\\nQuestion 2: Python has a unit testing framework called _____________. \\n\\n1. unittest \\n2. pytest \\n3. nose \\n4. main \\n\\nexplanation: The correct answer is labeled with 1. unittest because it is a built-in module that provides a framework for creating and running tests. \\n\\nQuestion 3: When should unit tests be written? \\n\\n1. After code is written \\n2. Before requirements are detailed \\n3. Before testing any other code \\n4. Constantly updating \\n\\nexplanation: The correct answer is labeled with 4. Constantly updating. Although writing tests early on is recommended, it is important to keep them updated as the code and requirements change. \\n\\nQuestion 4: What is the benefit of having a comprehensive test suite when writing code in a team? \\n\\n1. To decrease chances of breaking someone else's code \\n2. To increase the complexity of the code base \\n3. To make the code more difficult to test \\n4. To waste time running tests \\n\\nexplanation: The correct answer is labeled with 1. To decrease chances of breaking someone else's code because a comprehensive test suite ensures that the code can be run along with others without any conflicts, decreasing the chances of breaking someone else's code.\",\n",

    "Unit testing is an important part of an overall testing-centric development strategy. If you write unit tests, it is important to write them early and to keep them updated as code and requirements change.

But unit tests are beneficial no matter when you write them.\n",

A team breaks up the assignment, everybody takes the specs for their task, writes unit tests for it, then shares their unit tests with the rest of the team. That way, nobody goes off too far into developing code that doesn’t play well with others.'''},\n",
